This repository contains basic exercises in Python to demonstrate fundamental concepts such as lists, tuples, input/output operations, and operators.

## Lists

- **Creating and Modifying Lists:**
  - An empty list is initialized using `my_list = []`.
  - Elements are added using the `append` method: `my_list.append('element')`.
  - An element is inserted at a specific position using `insert`: `my_list.insert(index, 'element')`.
  - An element is removed using the `remove` method: `my_list.remove('element')`.
  - The final state of the list is printed using `print(my_list)`.

## Tuples

- **Creating and Manipulating Tuples:**
  - A tuple is initialized with multiple elements using `my_tuple = (element1, element2, ...)`.
  - Tuple unpacking assigns each element to a variable: `a, b, c = my_tuple`.
  - Tuples are concatenated using the `+` operator: `concatenated_tuple = tuple1 + tuple2`.
  - Elements are accessed using positive and negative indexing: `my_tuple[index]` and `my_tuple[-index]`.
  - Tuples are immutable; attempting to modify an element raises a `TypeError`.

## Input and Output

- **User Interaction:**
  - User input is obtained using the `input` function: `name = input("Enter your name: ")`.
  - A personalized message is printed using formatted strings: `print(f"Welcome, {name}!")`.
  - Users are prompted to enter numbers, which are converted to integers, and their sum and product are calculated: `num1 = int(input("Enter number: "))`.

## Operators

- **Using Operators:**
  - A variable is initialized with an integer value: `number = 15`.
  - The modulus operator checks if the number is even or odd: `number % 2`.
  - Comparison operators check if the number meets a condition: `number >= 10`.
  - Logical operators combine conditions to create complex conditions: `if condition1 and condition2`.
